# Reference

Going to replace the function of stuff in the games folder.
The goal is to create support systems to provide references to the rest of the application.
The current system is far too manual.
Too much boilerplate. I am sure that I can do this all in a couple of lines.

Most of my effort should just be spent organizing the files.
I just need to specify a system for everything to come cleanly together.
